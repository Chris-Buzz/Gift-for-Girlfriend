  "In your eyes, I see forever; A bond so strong, no force can sever; Through every trial, through joy and pain; Our love remains, a bright refrain; Your laughter lights my darkest days; A guiding star, a warming blaze; Each moment shared, a gift so rare;With you, my heart finds love laid bare; Forevermore, my soul will say; You are my light, my night, my day. ",
  "You’d never known the word love; Believing someday it’d come from up above; To only find that it was right in front of you; If only you had a clue; Thinking you lost your chance; That’d you'd never be able to give this girl a dance; Then you find out the fire between you could be true; The force you see could break a dam; That girl is you Sam.",
  "No treasure on Earth could match your worth; No diamond shines like your laughter; The way you love, the way you care; Has filled my life with treasures rare; Your touch, your words, all more valuable than gold; I belong with you; No gift could I give that equals your grace; You are my heart’s most loved space.",
  "The sun shines for 8 hours a day; But for me it shines 24/7; That’s because of this girl; Her presence can light up a room; Her smile can make you blind; Her laughter casts rays that can be seen from different galaxies; She is a star that never stops burning in my day. ",
  "Sometimes the darkness wins; It settles over me like a heavy fog; Dulling the edges of the world; Filling my mind with silence that feels too loud; I move through it slowly; Every step heavier than the last; Wondering if it will ever lift; Or if this is where I’m meant to stay; And then there’s you; You don’t banish the darkness; You don’t pretend it isn’t there; You just sit with me in it; Your presence a quiet reminder; That I’m not alone; You bring warmth where there was only cold; Not with bright flashes or grand gestures; But with the steady light of who you are; Because of you, I remember; The darkness is not endless; It is only a passing moment; In a life filled with your love.",
  "Loudness;Sometimes the world is too loud; and everyone else is talking; the quiet I crave is you; You listen to me without judgment,without interruption,as though my words matter; In a room full of voices,you hear me—not just the sound,but the weight behind it, the things I cannot say, I can’t get out; You hold my silence,and in that stillness,I find the space to be truly known; While others offer advice; you simply listen,and that is enough; Your presence alone gives me peace, reminds me that I am understood, even in my most difficult moments.",
  "When the world feels to heavy; And everything is unknown; Your presence is where I find peace; In your eyes, I see no judgment,only acceptance and calm; You are my sanctuary,the place where I can breathe,where I am simply enough.",

  Hey beautiful, aka Sam, aka my special girlfriend.
  Isn't this a surprise? Did you expect me to make an app for you? Did this pass your mind at all when you were guessing what I “got” for you. 
  You know, for a long time I was thinking of buying tickets to go to a drake concert together however they were either far away or really expensive and so I scrambled. At the start of December I had an aha moment. 
  I know how to code so why don’t I do my best and do everything I can to make an app for my gorgeous girlfriend. She deserves the world so the least I could do is spend a few hours everyday from now until Christmas 
  to make an app for her and I hope you like it. I probably by this time already mentioned to you that I can update and change the app to whatever you want. I can add more comments or pictures or even more things on it 
  if you want. I am the one who controls it so anything you want done to it say the word and I’ll make it happen and when a change happens like all updates I’ll send you little patch notes on what changed. Now I just want 
  to say how lucky I am to have you as a girlfriend. You are the best thing that has ever happened to me. I don’t think I emphasize that enough. I can truly be myself around you and feel free to let my childish behavior out. 
  I am the happiest and the most giddy when I am around you. I am so excited to spend this holiday season with you gorgeous, aka Sam, aka the most beautiful girl in the world. I can’t wait to build that gingerbread house 
  together, wear our matching pajamas tonight, watch a Christmas movie and hopefully when it snows go sledding together. You truly make me the best version of me that I can be and I can’t wait to spend many more holidays 
  with you my love.
  I love you so much Sam, more than words can ever describe. 
  From Chris & Willie❤️`;
